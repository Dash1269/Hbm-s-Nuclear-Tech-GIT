Includes the performance update and all latest bugfixes from upstream NTMain - see [X5202](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27_X5202) and [X5209](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27_X5209)

## Added
* All new bedrock ore processing!
  * Utilises the new system in NTMain, rebalanced and reworked for space!
  * Drilling raw bedrock on Eve requires potassium permanganate, and Dres requires nitric acid

## Changed
* Rotary furnace now needs a breathable atmosphere to operate
* Filters on conveyor ejectors/sorters/etc can now filter on bedrock ore grades, so if you want to filter on crumbs you don't have to add every single crumb type (of which there are _many_ more now!)
* Raw bedrock ore densities are now unique per seed + dimension, before it was identical over _every_ world AND dimension
  * This means the upstream change that ore taken from the creative tab "...now has the stats of the position the player is in..." won't work (server/client sync issue, the client does not know world seed!). Instead, it'll be a perfectly average ore (1.0 in all stats)
* /ntmstations tp command can now teleport you to planetary drives too, making saving the location of your builds in creative a breeze
* Config option added to disable mun cows
* Oxygen and jetpack tanks now stack to 16 and won't be consumed if your PLSS or jetpack is full

## Fixed
* All fixes from upstream NTM
* Certain rocket parts no longer render beyond their inventory slot
* HTR-3 and HTR-F4 issues fixed, and extra tooltips added to make it easier to understand how to fuel and operate them
* Rockets and drop pods now gravity turn to the east when launching
* Fix DNT Nano Suit not showing that it is compatible with the PLSS
